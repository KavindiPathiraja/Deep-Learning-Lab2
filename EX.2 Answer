1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?

Model Capacity Increases
More hidden nodes = more weights and parameters.
The model can represent more complex functions and capture subtle patterns in the training data.

Training Accuracy Improves
With more nodes, the network has enough capacity to fit the training set very well.
Often, training accuracy goes up and might even reach ~100% if the network is large enough.

Risk of Overfitting

If the number of nodes becomes too large, the network memorizes the training data instead of generalizing.
Test accuracy may plateau or even drop due to overfitting.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 
Few nodes -> Underfitting

Accuracy is low on both training and test sets.
Model is too simple, canâ€™t capture data patterns.

Moderate nodes -> Optimal Zone

Training accuracy increases, and test accuracy also increases.
Model learns patterns well and generalizes properly.

Too many nodes -> Overfitting Zone

Training accuracy may be very high (close to 100%).
Test accuracy starts to decrease or plateau because the model memorizes training data instead of generalizing.
